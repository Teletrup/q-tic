it would be better of with just score
  the score would be number of marks in a line longer than 2

todo
  literal edge case with updateWinner
    didn't optional-chain all the way
  non-classical win

get a good debugging tool
  


rename iRow, iCol to x, y?
innerTable?
sane numeric range iteration

voodoo
	ocell table as 'value' property
		then isOccupied works for both

translucent element that indicates "disabled"?

separate outer cell and inner table?

collapse the current cell before collapsing others
  should it matter?

when collapsing, exempt the source cell
  what if the cell is collapsed directly?
    call with null

when icell isn't taken, block the opposite

eliminate invalid states first
factor out the click validation?

advanced types, valid board, validation layer

plain ol' subroutines?

hacks
  disabling an icell so it doesn't recur back and forth

the weird freezes happen because the state changes, but the update doesn't return,
so the state doesn't get rendered

why don't I use the debugger
and word highlighting

have one queue, breadth first

separate model and view
  not clickable are always disabled
    they are just gray when they're empty

using stash instead of multiple files
